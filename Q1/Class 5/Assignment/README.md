Tasks for this week!!

1. Create a modular calculator program using TypeScript. The program should take user input through the Inquirer library and implement various arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) as separate ES modules. 

2. Create a quiz application using TypeScript and the Inquirer library. The program should take user input through Inquirer, implement a quiz with a variable number of questions, calculate the quiz score in separate ES module, and display the final result along with correct and incorrect user-given answers. 

Note: you can also use Chalk library for adding color to the console output.
